# Task Services
A go micro-services project that provide backend to a task application.

## Road map
What i want to do with the app:
- Have a server storing all the data and serve the data through a gRPC connection.
- Have a client app that interact with the server. CLI at first, GUI latter.

The app will follow the common project structure.
